# Gargoyle 74 character sheet module for foundryVTT.

This basic module adds the gargoyle 74 character sheet. Not as a system module, but as an add-on top of a system.
#
A request to include it within Foundry has been sent but not yet confirmed, so as of right now - you can only manually install it.
#
install via the manifest URL:
#
https://github.com/gargoyle74/gargoyle-74/releases/download/v1.0.1/module.json
#
Since its a first release, there are probably bugs or a need to smooth things over. please let me know.
